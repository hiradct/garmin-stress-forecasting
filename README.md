The common saying, "Stress is a silent killer!" has become a proverbial phrase. As the late Hungarian-Canadian Hans Selye, the father of stress research, famously said, "It's not stress that kills us; it's our reaction to it." But what is stress? Simply put, stress is our body's reaction to a particular challenge. Small, short-term bursts of stress are beneficial for our health. In contrast, the lingering chronic types are harmful to our body and mind in the long term.

The good news is that stress management science and technology are rapidly evolving. With accessible heart rate monitors in smartwatches, we can now indirectly measure our bodyâ€™s response to psychological stressors. Some companies, such as Garmin, are providing real-time Stress Scores to users based on their phycological measures. Would it be possible to use the same Stress Score data to forecast our stress values in future hours or days?

The purpose of this study was to assess the forecastability of Garmin's Stress Score utilizing only historical values. The scope of the analysis was limited to one participant's data collected over four months. Garmin is a wearable technology company that provides stress monitoring features in its latest watches. The feature gives users a 0-100 stress level and interpretation, such as "Rest" or "High" to inform users of their real-time stress levels.
